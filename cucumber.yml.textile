Cucumber lets you store and reuse commonly used cucumber command line arguments for a project in a <code>cucumber.yml</code> file. This file must be in your project's root directory, <code>config</code> or <code>.config</code>.

For example, by having this in your <code>config/cucumber.yml</code>:

<pre><code>default: --format profile features
html_report: --format progress --format html --out=features_report.html features  
</code></pre>

You can reuse the arguments listed above:
<pre><code>cucumber --profile html_report
</code></pre>

It is important to point out that by simply running 'cucumber' the default profile will be used (if a cucumber.yml file is found in the current directory).

h2. Preprocessing with ERb

The cucumber.yml file is interpreted as an ERB file; this allows you to use ruby code to generate values in the cucumber.yml file. So if you have several profiles with similar values you could do something like:

<pre>
<% common = "--tags ~@wip --strict" %>
default: <%= common %> features  
html_report: <%= common %> --format progress --format html --out=features_report.html features  
</pre>

Also see [[Running Features]] for more details about how to execute your features.
