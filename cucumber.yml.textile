Cucumber lets you store and reuse commonly used cucumber command line arguments for a project in a <code>cucumber.yml</code> file. This file must be in your project's root directory. (Actually, Cucumber looks for it in the current directory, but this is usually the root directory of your project).

For example, by having this in your cucumber.yml at your project root:

<pre><code>default: --format profile features
html_report: --format progress --format html --out=features_report.html features  
</code></pre>

You can reuse the arguments listed above:
<pre><code>cucumber --profile html_report
</code></pre>

It is important to point out that by simply running 'cucumber' the default profile will be used (if a cucumber.yml file is found in the current directory).

Also see [[Running Features]] for more details about how to execute your features.
