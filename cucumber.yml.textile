Cucumber lets you store and reuse commonly used cucumber command line arguments for a project in a <code>cucumber.yml</code> file. This file must be in your project's root directory. (Actually, Cucumber looks for it in the current directory, but this is usually the root directory of your project).

For example, by having this in your cucumber.yml at your project root:

<pre><code>default: --format profile features
html_report: --format progress --format html --out=features_report.html features  
</code></pre>

You can reuse the arguments listed above:
<pre><code>cucumber --profile html_report
</code></pre>

It is important to point out that by simply running 'cucumber' the default profile will be used (if a cucumber.yml file is found in the current directory).

As of commit 06810452b36d876061b9cfbd6c93bfcfcb58c00e on 28 Aug 2009, included in the 0.3.99 and later releases of cucumber, the cucumber.yml file is interpreted as an ERB file; this allows you to use ruby code to generate values in the cucumber.yml file. Someone should post some examples of this sometime.
