This is related to problem described in this "ticket":https://webrat.lighthouseapp.com/projects/10503/tickets/168-redirects-in-rails-23-not-being-followed-by-webrat. We faced this problem in webrat <b>0.7</b> while using with subdomain_fu.
<b>Solution.</b>
Defining tld_sizes for subdomain_fu solved this problem.
Create a file called subdomain_fu.rb under config/initializers with following content.
SubdomainFu.tld_sizes = {
    :development => 0, :test => 1, :production => 1, :cucumber => 1
}
