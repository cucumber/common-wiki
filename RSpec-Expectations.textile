To use RSpec's expectations (<code>should</code>), make sure the following is in features/support/env.rb:

<pre>
require 'spec/expectations'
</pre>

'spec/expectations' also includes 'spec/matchers'. When cucumber sees the Spec::Matchers and Spec::Expectations defined, it will implicitly include them in the World in which the steps are executed.

Do not <code>require 'spec'</code>, because that loads up a bunch of rspec modules that you don't need and might get in your way.
