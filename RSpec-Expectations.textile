To use RSpec's expectations (<code>should</code>), make sure the following is in features/support/env.rb:

<pre>
require 'spec/expectations'
require 'spec/matchers'
</pre>

When cucumber sees the Spec::Matchers and Spec::Expectations modules defined, it will implicitly include them in the World in which the steps are executed.

You can also just <code>require 'spec'</code>, but that loads up a bunch of rspec modules that you won't need.
