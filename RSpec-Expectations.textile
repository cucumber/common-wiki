To use RSpec's expectations (<code>should</code>), make sure the following is in features/support/env.rb:

<pre>
require 'spec/expectations'
</pre>

<code>'spec/expectations'</code> also includes <code>'spec/matchers'</code>. When cucumber sees the <code>Spec::Matchers</code> and <code>Spec::Expectations</code> modules defined, it will implicitly include them in the World in which the steps are executed.

*Do not* <code>require 'spec'</code>, because that loads up a bunch of RSpec modules that you don't need and might get in your way.
