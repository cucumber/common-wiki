Simple load the @ae@ library.

<pre>
  require 'ae'
</pre>

If you want the subjective forms, then require it as well.

<pre>
  require 'ae'
  require 'ae/should'
</pre>

You do not need to add anything to Cucumber's "World", because AE works at the top-level, rather then simply defining a set of assertion methods.
