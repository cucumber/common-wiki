Got questions? Here is where you can get in touch:

* "Mailing list":http://rubyforge.org/mail/?group_id=797
* "Lighthouse":http://rspec.lighthouseapp.com/projects/16211-cucumber/overview
* "IRC":irc://irc.freenode.net/cucumber

This is usually better than contacting individual developers directly. If you think you have found a bug, please try the latest gem version as well as the latest code here on GitHub before asking questions. When you file a bug report or ask a question, let us know what versions of relevant software you're using - at the very least the Cucumber version (<code>cucumber --version</code>) or what git commit you built from.
