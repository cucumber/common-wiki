h2. Before you consider asking

Try the latest released gem: <code>gem update cucumber</code>

If that doesn't help, try the latest beta gem: <code>gem install aslakhellesoy-cucumber --source http://gems.github.com/</code>

h2. Before you ask

Most people use Cucumber in more or less complex environments where a lot of other code is involved. Various web frameworks, many different ruby gems and your own code. There are many different ways you can "run features":running-features and many things that can go wrong - and quite often it has nothing to do with Cucumber at all.

So when you ask a question, please tell us:

* What cucumber version you're using: <code>cucumber --version</code>
* What other gems and versions you're using: <code>gem list</code>
* What command you ran
* What the output, error message and trace was: <code>--backtrace --verbose</code>
* What relevant code you have. Don't _describe_ your code, show it: "http://gist.github.com/":http://gist.github.com/
* And finally, tell us how to reproduce the error, as described on the [[Contributing]] page.
