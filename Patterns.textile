A draft list of useful Cucumber patterns:
* XPath Sections
** Description: ability to scope an inspection or webrat step to a part of the html.
** Motivation: when an element appears at multiple locations in an html page you want the ability to specify which one a step refers to
** Examples:
*** When I follow "next" in the pagination section
*** Then I should see "logout" in the account section
** Implementation: a mapping of section names to xpaths that can be used for scoping, a patch of webrat is needed to allow xpaths to be used
* Easy objects
** Description: generic step to create objects in a rails app
** Motivation: when writing cucumber for rails, you often want to create some objects and set their properties
** Examples:
*** <pre>Given the following People exist:
| name | date of birth |
| john | 20 Jan 1980   |
| mary | 10 days ago   |</pre>
** Implementation:
*** Generic step that has a model name and a table as arguments
*** Factory used to create an object for each row with the properties defined in the table
*** Transforms that map the properties to the correct type
