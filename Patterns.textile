A draft list of useful Cucumber patterns:
* Sections
** Description: ability to scope an inspection or webrat step.
** Examples:
*** When I follow "next" in the pagination section
*** Then I should see "logout" in the account section
** Implementation: a mapping of section names to xpaths that can be used for scoping, a patch of webrat is needed to allow xpaths to be used
