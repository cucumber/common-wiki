These are standalone install instructions. In order to use Cucumber within some frameworks, see also:
* install for [[Ruby on Rails]]
* install for [[JRuby and Java]]
* install for [[IronRuby and .NET]]

h2. Installing the Gem

After you have installed Ruby and RubyGems, install Cucumber with the following command:

<pre>gem install cucumber</pre>

This is a good time to get familiar with <code>--help</code>

<pre>cucumber --help</pre>

h2. Building the Gem yourself

Install a dependency:

<pre>sudo gem install sdoc</pre>

Then get the code via Git (or download a tarball):

<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber.git
cd cucumber
rake install_gem
</code></pre>
