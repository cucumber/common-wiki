Tags is a great way to organise your features and scenarios. Consider this example:

<pre>
@billing
Feature: Verify billing

  @important
  Scenario: Missing product description

  Scenario: Several products
</pre>

You can use the <code>--tags</code> option to tell Cucumber that you only want to run features or scenarios that have (or don't have) certain tags. Examples:

<pre>
cucumber --tags @billing     # Runs both scenarios
cucumber --tags @important   # Runs the first scenario
cucumber --tags ~@important  # Runs the second scenario (Any scenario that doesn't have @important)
</pre>

Tags is also a great way to "link" your Cucumber features to other documents. For example, if you have to deal with old school requirements in a different system (Word, Excel, a wiki) you can refer to numbers:

<pre>
@BJ-x98.77 @BJ-z12.33
Feature: Convert transaction
</pre>

Another creative way to use tags is to keep track of where in the development process a certain feature is:

<pre>
@qa_ready
Feature: Index projects
</pre>

Another way to "filter" what you want to run is to use the <code>file.feature:line</code> pattern or the <code>--scenario</code> option as described in [[Running Features]].
