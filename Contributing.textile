Please follow these guidelines if you want to contribute to Cucumber.

h2. You have found a bug

Before you [[get in touch]] and file a ticket in the issue tracker, make sure you have tried the latest gem. Also try to [[install]] the latest code from Git. This way you don't waste the developers' time by reporting a bug that has already been fixed.

If you are certain you have found a bug, just register a ticket. If you're not sure, please ask on the mailing list first.

h3. Help us fix it

The only way we can fix a bug is to reproduce it first. If reproducing the bug requires setting up a project, please write a [[Cucumber Feature]] that demonstrates the bug. When you have done that, mention it in your ticket or send a pull request.

Explain what gem you have (<code>gem list</code>), what command(s) you ran, what the output is etc. 

h2. You want a new feature

Start by creating a ticket. Then, create a [[Cucumber Feature]] and start implementing it. It also helps if you add RSpec specs for the low level code.
