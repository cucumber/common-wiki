We recommend you exercise your whole stack when using Cucumber. You *can* set up mocks with expectations in your [[Step Definitions]]. You can read more about how in "Bryan Helkamp's blog post":http://www.brynary.com/2009/2/3/cucumber-step-definition-tip-stubbing-time.
As of RSpec 1.2.8 if you need to use stubs within Cucumber and you are using the built in mocking framework that ships with RSpec you simply need to <pre>require 'spec/stubs/cucumber'</pre> in your env.rb file.

We recommend you only mock and stub things like Time and external services like OpenID etc.
