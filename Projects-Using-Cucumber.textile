Here is a list of projects using Cucumber. I find reading them to be a great learning experience.

Projects using Cucumber:
* "Clearance":http://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/ /generators/clearance_features/templates/features/
* "WebJam":http://github.com/webjam/webjam/ /features/
* "Redcar":http://github.com/danlucraft/redcar/tree/master /plugins/*/features


Note: I had initially copied the [[Examples]] page. I created this page because I consider this page to be a more appropriate name.
