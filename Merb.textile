Cucumber can be used with "Merb":http://merbivore.com/ via the "merb_cucumber":http://github.com/david/merb_cucumber plugin.

To install merb_cucumber:

*sudo gem install david-merb_cucumber*

Or you can install "jsmestad-merb_cucumber ":http://github.com/jsmestad/merb_cucumber
*sudo gem install jsmestad-merb_cucumber*

Here is brief note from jsmestad.

bq. Note – you must uninstall david-merb_cucumber in order for this gem to take precedence. Merb + Cucumber + Webrat testing stack. Builds upon David’s work, but binds Webrat as a dependency to hopefully ensure a smooth upgrade for future Webrat releases. Also Factory_Girl generators will be added soon.


Then inside of a merb application directory, try:

*merb-gen cucumber*

I found this walk-through useful - "Writing User Stories with merb_cucumber":http://dermological.blogspot.com/2008/11/writing-user-stories-with-merb-cucumber.html

Looking for Examples?
-----------------------------

So am I. Therefore I've been scrounging github in search of some. Lots of merb projects out there with empty /features sitting around.
In my experience, searching github for anything highly particular like this is not useful.

But, please add some when you find them! 

Here are some merb projects that use cucumber (feel free to add/update/delete this list accordingly, I did not rigorously weed through each one but I did only include /features that had actual examples):
