Cucumber can be used with "Merb":http://merbivore.com/ via the "merb_cucumber":http://github.com/jsmestad/merb_cucumber plugin.

To install merb_cucumber:

*sudo gem install jsmestad-merb_cucumber*

(Note from jsmestad – you must uninstall david-merb_cucumber in order for this gem to take precedence.
Merb + Cucumber + Webrat testing stack. Builds upon David’s work, but binds Webrat as a dependency to hopefully ensure a smooth upgrade for future Webrat releases. Also Factory_Girl generators will be added soon.)

Then inside of a merb application directory, try:

*merb-gen cucumber*
