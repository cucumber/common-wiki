The RDoc for the latest Cucumber code is hosted at "http://cukes.info/cucumber/api/ruby/latest/":http://cukes.info/cucumber/api/ruby/latest/
This documentation always reflects the HEAD of aslakhellesoy's master branch and may therefore be slightly different from the latest gem release.

If you want the RDoc for a particular version of Cucumber you must build it yourself:

<pre>
gem install rdoc
gem install cucumber
gem server &
open http://localhost:8808/doc_root/cucumber-0.3.5/rdoc
</pre>

(You may have to change the version number in that URL)
