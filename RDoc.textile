The RDoc for the latest Cucumber code is hosted on "rdoc.info":http://rdoc.info/projects/aslakhellesoy/cucumber
This documentation always reflects the HEAD of aslakhellesoy's master branch.

If you want the RDoc for a particular version of Cucumber you must build it yourself:

<pre>
gem install rdoc
gem install cucumber
gem server &
open http://localhost:8808/doc_root/cucumber-0.3.5/rdoc
</pre>

(You may have to chenge the version number in that URL)
