We haven't put up the RDoc for Cucumber online yet, so until that happens, here is how you can read it on your own machine:

<pre>
gem install rdoc
gem install cucumber
gem server &
open http://localhost:8808/doc_root/cucumber-0.3.5/rdoc
</pre>

(You may have to chenge the version number in that URL)
