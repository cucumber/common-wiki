It's easy to write your own custom formatter for Cucumber. Maybe you want to create a formatter that posts a message to Twitter every time a step fails? (I'm sure that would get you a lot of followers). Here is how you'd do that:

Save your custom formatter class in <code>features/support</code> (or if you want to put it elsewhere, put a file in that directory that <code>require</code>s your formatter class.

<pre>
require 'twitter'

module Silly
  class TwitterFormatter
    def initialize(io, step_mother, options={})
      # We don't care about these - we're just twittering!
    end

    def scenario_executing(scenario)
      @failed = false
    end

    def scenario_executed(scenario)
      status = @failed ? 'FAILED' : 'PASSED'
      message = "#{scenario.name} #{status}"
      Twitter::Base.new('your email', 'your password').post(message)
    end

    def step_failed(step, regexp, args)
      @failed = true
    end
  end
end
</pre>

Now you can run your features by passing <code>--format Silly::TwitterFormatter</code>
