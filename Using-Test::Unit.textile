Don't like RSpec's <code>should</code> methods for assertions? No problem, we won't force you to. You can use the familiar Test::Unit <code>assert</code> methods by mixing it into your "World":a-whole-new-world.

<pre>
require 'test/unit/assertions'

World(Test::Unit::Assertions)
</pre>

You can see a full example under the "examples":http://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/tree/master/examples%2Ftest_unit
