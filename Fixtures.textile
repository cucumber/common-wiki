Paste this code snippet into env.rb to load all fixtures from spec/fixtures before each scenario.

<pre>Before do
  Fixtures.reset_cache
  fixtures_folder = File.join(RAILS_ROOT, 'spec', 'fixtures')
  fixtures = Dir[File.join(fixtures_folder, '*.yml')].map {|f| File.basename(f, '.yml') }
  Fixtures.create_fixtures(fixtures_folder, fixtures)
end
</pre>

If you are using transactional fixtures in Rails then instead of loading your fixtures before each scenario you can load it just once by placing the same code in your env.rb file.  This way will be much faster than loading the fixtures before each scenario. For example:

<pre># Sets up the Rails environment for Cucumber
ENV["RAILS_ENV"] = "test"
require File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../../config/environment')
require 'cucumber/rails/world'
Cucumber::Rails.use_transactional_fixtures

#Seed the DB
Fixtures.reset_cache  
fixtures_folder = File.join(RAILS_ROOT, 'spec', 'fixtures')
fixtures = Dir[File.join(fixtures_folder, '*.yml')].map {|f| File.basename(f, '.yml') }
Fixtures.create_fixtures(fixtures_folder, fixtures)
</pre>

#Usage
Once you've done one of the two load methods above (please, don't do both ;-) you can access your fixture data from the database using *Model.find*.  Example to find the first User model you'd use User.find(:first).

#Fixture helper methods
If you want to also enable the fixture helper methods, such as *users(:admin)*, you need to add the following (pretty much stolen straight from the Rails guts) after loading fixtures in the env.rb file, as above:

<pre>World do |world|

  (class << world; self; end).class_eval do
    @@fixture_cache = {}
    fixtures.each do |table_name|
      table_name = table_name.to_s.tr('.', '_')
      define_method(table_name) do |*fixture_symbols|
        @@fixture_cache[table_name] ||= {}

        instances = fixture_symbols.map do |fixture_symbol|
          if fix = Fixtures.cached_fixtures(ActiveRecord::Base.connection, table_name)[fixture_symbol.to_s]
            @@fixture_cache[table_name][fixture_symbol] ||= fix.find  # find model.find's the instance
          else
            raise StandardError, "No fixture with name '#{fixture_symbol}' found for table '#{table_name}'"
          end
        end
        instances.size == 1 ? instances.first : instances
      end
    end
  end
  world
end
</pre>
