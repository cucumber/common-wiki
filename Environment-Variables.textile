When you are [[Running Features]] it can sometimes be handy to pass special values to Cucumber so that they can be picked up in your [[Step Definitions]]. You can easily do this on the command line:

<pre>
cucumber FOO=BAR --format progress features
</pre>

You can now pick up <code>ENV['FOO']</code> in ruby (for example in env.rb or a step definition) and take actions according to the value.

You can also do this in [[cucumber.yml]].  For example, this sets up a profile that runs a tag and sets an environment variable

<pre>
baz: --tags @mytag FOO=BAR
</pre>
