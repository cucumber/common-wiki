Hi,

Can anyone let me know how to Parametrization in cucumber feature file e.g:-

I have created an feature file for login for different urls , what i want is to Parametrize the user and password in feature file so that i can user different users every time i login. But i want this file to be independent of the feature file which i have created.


thanks
