It is possible to call steps from step definitions:

<pre>
Given /^A user (.*) exists$/ do |name|
  # ...
end

Given /^I log in as (.*)$/ do |name|
  # ...
end

Given /^(.*) is logged in$/ do |name|
  Given "A user #{name} exists"
  Given "I log in as #{name}"
end
</pre>

This is pracical if you have several common steps that you want to perform in several scenarios. This allows you to do this in a Scenario:

<code>
Scenario: View last incidents
  Given Linda is logged in # This will in fact invoke 2 step definitions
</code>
