h2. How to use RCov with Cucumber and Rails


This page serves as an easy way to learn how to use cucumber and RCov together.

h3. Quick example

First, Aslak recommends that you use spicycode's RCov instead of the 'official' one, as it currently segfaults too much for most people's taste.

<pre>
gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
gem uninstall rcov
gem install spicycode-rcov
</pre>

Second, you'll need to open up the cucumber generated task file and add the rcov option.

<pre>
#lib/tasks/cucumber.rake
$:.unshift(RAILS_ROOT + '/vendor/plugins/cucumber/lib')
require 'cucumber/rake/task'
Cucumber::Rake::Task.new(:features) do |t|
  t.cucumber_opts = "--format pretty"
  t.rcov = true
end
task :features => 'db:test:prepare'
</pre>

Now when you run rake:features, coverage information will be in rails_root/coverage
