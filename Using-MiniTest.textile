You can also use "minitest":https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest <code>assert</code> methods by defining your own "World":a-whole-new-world block:

h3. Minitest 5

<pre>
require 'minitest/spec'

class MyWorld
  extend Minitest::Assertions
  attr_accessor :assertions

  def initialize
    self.assertions = 0
  end
end

World do
  MyWorld.new
end
</pre>

h3. Older versions

<pre>
require 'mini/test'

World do |world|
  world.extend(Mini::Test::Assertions)
  world
end
</pre>

If it doesn't work, try this one:

<pre>
require 'minitest/unit'

World do
  extend Mini::Test::Assertions
end
</pre>

Or

<pre>
require 'minitest/unit'
World(MiniTest::Assertions)
</pre>

Also, if you wanted to use MiniTest::Spec, the snippet would look like this:

<pre>
require 'minitest/spec'
World(MiniTest::Assertions)
MiniTest::Spec.new(nil)
</pre>
