Cucumber provides a number of hooks which allow us to run blocks at various points in the Cucumber test cycle. There is no association between where the hook is defined and which scenario/step it is run for. 

Every hook gets added to a global stack, and then each hook in the stack gets executed before or after the scenario.

All hooks defined are run whenever the relevant event occurs. For example all Before hooks defined throughout the required code will be run for each scenario.

h2. Scenario hooks

<pre><code>Before do
  # do something before each scenario.
end
</code></pre>

or - if you want to inspect the actual scenario object:

<pre><code>Before do |scenario|
  @scenario = scenario
  # our After block can look at @scenario to find out stuff later...
end
</code></pre>

<pre><code>After do
  #do something after each scenario
end
</code></pre>

h2. Step hooks

<pre><code>AfterStep do
  #do something after each step
end
</code></pre>

h2. Global hooks

If you want something to happen once before any scenario is run - just put that code at the top-level in your <code>env.rb</code> file (or any other file in your <code>features/support</code> directory. Use <code>Kernel#at_exit</code> for global teardown. Example:

<pre><code>
my_heavy_object = HeavyObject.new
my_heavy_object.do_it

at_exit do
  my_heavy_object.undo_it
end
</code></pre>

h2. Tagged hooks

*Only available in Cucumber 0.3.0 and above*

Sometimes you may want a certain before or after hook to run only for certain scenarios. This can be achieved by associating a hook with one or more [[tags]]. Example:

<pre><code>
Before('@cucumis', '@sativus') do
  # This will only run before scenarios tagged
  # with @cucumis or @sativus.
end
</code></pre>
