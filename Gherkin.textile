Gherkin is the language that Cucumber understands. It is a "Business Readable, Domain Specific Language":http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BusinessReadableDSL.html that lets you describe software's behaviour without detailing how that behaviour is implemented. Gherkin serves two purposes - documentation and automated tests.

Gherkin's grammar is defined in the Treetop grammar that is part of the Cucumber codebase. The grammar exists in different flavours for several [[Spoken languages]], where the keywords of the grammar have been localised.
