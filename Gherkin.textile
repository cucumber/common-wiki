Gherkin is the language that Cucumber understands. It is a "Business Readable, Domain Specific Language":http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BusinessReadableDSL.html that has been designed specifically for Cucumber.

Gherkin's grammar is defined in the Treetop grammar that is part of the Cucumber codebase. The grammar exists in different flavours for several [[Spoken languages]], where the keywords of the grammar have been localised.
