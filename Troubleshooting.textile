Cucumber not ripe? Can't find your peeler? These are some common problems people have experienced. -And how to address them.

h2. Console output isn't right on Windows

Missing "a" characters in the output? Do your "æøå" characters print like garbled "Commodore 64 characters":http://kofler.dot.at/c64/? There are three steps to fix this.

First - add <code>require 'cucumber/formatters/unicode'</code> to your <code>env.rb</code> file. 

Second - set your command window's font to a font that has the characters you're outputting - for example _Upper Left corner icon menu -> Properties -> Font -> Lucida Grande_.

Third - in your command prompt, change the codepage:

<pre>chcp 1252</pre>

Now you should be able to get aæøå in your output on Windows.

Note that 1252 is not UTF-8 - it's essentially Latin1. You can also try to set it to 65001, which is UTF-8, but this has the "unfortunate side effect":http://www.google.no/search?q=chcp+65001+bat&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a of temporarily neutering all your computer's bat files so they cannot be executed (including cucumber.bat and rake.bat).
