The regular expression matching in [[Step Definitions]] lets you capture small strings from  your
steps and receive them in your step definitions. However, there are times when you want to pass
a richer data structure from a step to a step definition.

This is what multiline step arguments are for. They are written on the lines right underneath a step,
and will be yielded as the last argument to the matching step definition's block.

Multiline step arguments come in two flavours - tables or strings.

h2. Multiline Tables

Multiline Tables are handy for specifying a larger data set - usually as input to a <code>Given</code> or as expected 
output from a <code>When</code>. Example:

<pre><code>Given the following people exist:
  | name  | email           | phone |
  | Aslak | aslak@email.com | 123   |
  | Joe   | joe@email.com   | 234   |
  | Bryan | bryan@email.org | 456   |
</code></pre>

-and a matching step definition:

<pre><code>Given /the following people exist:/ do |people_table|
  people_table.hashes.each do |hash|
    # The first time the +hash+ will contain:
    #   {'name' => 'Aslak', 'email' => 'aslak@email.com', 'phone' => '123'} 
    # The second time:
    #   {'name' => 'Joe', 'email' => 'joe@email.com', 'phone' => '234'}
    # etc.
  end
end
</code></pre>

A plain text table gets stored in a <code>Cucumber::Ast::Table</code> object, which provides several methods to access the
rows, columns and cells in the table. In the example above we're using the <code>Cucumber::Ast::Table#hashes</code> method
to iterate over all of the rows.

h2. Multiline Strings

Multiline Strings are handy for specifying a larger piece of text. This is done using the PyString syntax. (The inspiration 
for PyString comes from Python where """ is used to delineate docstrings.)  The text should be offset by delimiters consisting 
of three double-quote marks on lines of their own:

<pre><code>Given a blog post named "Random" with Markdown body
  """
  Some Title, Eh?
  ==============
  Here is the first paragraph of my blog post. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
  consectetur adipiscing elit.
  """
</code></pre>

In your step definition, there's no need to find this text and match it in your Regexp. It will automatically be yielded as 
the last parameter in the step definition.  For example:

<pre><code>Given /^a blog post named "([^\"]*)" with Markdown body$/ do |title, markdown|
  Post.create!(:title => title, :body => markdown)
end
</code></pre>

Indentation of the opening <code>"""</code> is unimportant, although common practice is 2 spaces in from
the enclosing step. The indentation <em>inside</em> the triple quotes <em>do</em> have significance. Each
line of the string that gets passed to the step definition's block will be de-indented according to the 
opening <code>"""</code>. Indentation beyond the column of the opening <code>"""</code> will therefore be
preserved.

Cucumber stores multiline strings internally as a <code>Cucumber::Ast::PyString</code> object. However,
this gets converted to a regular <code>String</code> before it's passed to the step definition.

h2. Substitution in Scenario Outlines

If you use a multiline argument in steps in [[Scenario Outlines]], any <code>< ></code> 
delimited tokens will be substituted with values from the example tables. For example:

<pre><code>Scenario Outline: Email confirmation
  Given I have a user account with my name "Jojo Binks"
  When an Admin grants me <Role> rights
  Then I should receive an email with the body:
    """
    Dear Jojo Binks,
    You have been granted <Role> rights.  You are <details>. Please be responsible.
    -The Admins
    """
Examples:
  |  Role     | details                                         |
  |  Manager  | now able to manage your employee accounts       |
  |  Admin    | able to manage any user account on the system   |
</code></pre>

Or with tables:

<pre><code>Scenario Outline: Multiplying with 7
  Given I have the numbers
    | q1   | q2 | product |
    | <x>  |  7 | <y>     |
Examples:
  |  x |  y |
  |  2 | 14 |
  | 10 | 70 |
</code></pre>

h2. Using regular arguments and multiline arguments

It's possible to pass regular arguments in addition to multiline arguments. This is illustrated
for strings above in the blog example. Here is an example using tables:

<pre><code># ruby
Given /^an expense report for (.*) with the following posts:$/ do |date, posts_table|
  # The posts_table variable is an instance of Cucumber::Ast::Table
end
</code></pre>

This can easily be called from a plain text step like this:

<pre><code># feature
Given an expense report for Jan 2009 with the following posts:
  | account | description | amount |
  | INT-100 | Taxi        |    114 |
  | CUC-101 | Peeler      |     22 |
</code></pre>
