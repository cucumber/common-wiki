Cucumber runs fine on "JRuby":http://jruby.codehaus.org/. This means you can use Cucumber with plain Java code.

h2. Installing Cucumber in JRuby

To get started, you need the JDK, JRuby and Cucumber installed. I'm assuming you already know how to install Java - you probably already have it installed since you're reading this page.

h3. Install JRuby

Just download the latest "binary distribution":http://dist.codehaus.org/jruby/, unpack it and make sure the bin directory is on your <code>PATH</code>. To check that you have installed it properly, try out the following commands:

<pre>jruby --version</pre>

and

<pre>jruby -S rake --version</pre>

h3. Install Cucumber into JRuby

Just use the <code>gem</code> command from JRuby:

<pre>jruby -S gem install cucumber</pre>

To check that you have it installed properly, run:

<pre>jruby -S cucumber --help</pre>

When you run <code>jruby</code> with the <code>-S</code> switch, jruby will look for the script (in this case <code>cucumber</code>) in jruby's <code>bin</code> directory before it starts looking at the <code>PATH</code>. It will find the <code>cucumber</code> ruby script inside JRuby's bin that was created when you installed the gem.

h2. Running the examples

The "examples":http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/tree/master/examples are included in the gem.

Open a command prompt and cd to the Cucumber examples directory. You'll find them under <code>$JRUBY_HOME/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/cucumber-X.Y.Z/examples</code>. (Replace <code>X.Y.Z</code> with the Cucumber version you installed above).

If you pulled the Cucumber code with Git, you'll find the examples under <code>examples</code>.

h3. Run the plain ruby example

<pre><code>cd i18n/en
jruby -S cucumber features
</code></pre>

The Code under test is pure Ruby, so it's not that interesting in the context of JRuby.

h3. Run the Java example

<pre><code>cd java
jruby -S rake features
</code></pre>

This will compile the java code and then run Cucumber features against that code.

h3. Using Maven

Apache "Maven":http://maven.apache.org/ is a popular build tool for Java. If you're already using Maven you might be interested in running Cucumber with Maven too. Madaspeak has written a "great blog post":http://binil.wordpress.com/2008/10/29/running-cucumber-on-jrubymaven/ showing how to do this.

h3. Using Ant
